# cuda_boilerplate
Cuda boilerplate for beginners (like me). Go beyond plus ultra!

## Introduction
This is a simple 'hello world' sort of program for CUDA. It takes in two images of the same size and type. Adds them up on the GPU and shows the result.

## Build Instructions
Go to the the main folder and execute the following commands on the terminal
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run Instructions
To run the program execute the following line on a terminal after building successfully
```
./image
```
